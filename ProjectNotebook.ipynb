    "Especially in the beginning of the school quarter, it is quite difficult for students to remember what days and what times they have their classes. As a student myself, I find it very convenient and useful to have a school planner that lists out my weekly class schedule so that I can quickly refer to it whenever I need it. Thus for this final project, I decided to make a chatbot that allows the user to input what classes they're taking for that particular school quarter, as well as what days of the week and what times they have for each of their classes. After the user's responses are collected, a weekly class schedule is then generated for the user to easily view. The class schedule is in the form of a dataframe and orders the classes from earliest to latest for each day of the week."
